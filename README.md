## less-brunch
Adds [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) support to
[brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage
`npm install --save less-brunch`

### Options
Print source-file references in output by setting `dumpLineNumbers` in your
`brunch-config`:

```coffee
  plugins:
    less:
      dumpLineNumbers: 'comments' # other options: 'mediaquery', 'all'
```

### CSS Modules
Starting Brunch `<unreleased>`, you can use CSS Modules with less-brunch. To enable it, change your config to:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    less: {
      cssModules: true
    }
  }
};
```

Then, author your styles like you normally would:

```less
.title {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

And reference CSS class names by requiring the specific style into your javascript:

```javascript
var style = require('./title.less');

<h1 className={style.title}>Yo</h1>
```

Note: enabling `cssModules` does so for every stylesheet in your project, so it's all-or-nothing. Even the files you don't require will be transformed into CSS modules (aka will have obfuscated class names, like turn `.title` into `._title_fdphn_1`).
