## less-brunch
Adds [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) support to [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage
`npm install --save-dev less-brunch`

### Options
Pass options as per [LESS documentation](http://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser-options) in your `brunch-config.js`,
e.g. print source-file references in output by setting `dumpLineNumbers`.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    less: {
      dumpLineNumbers: 'comments', // other values: 'mediaquery', 'all'
      includePaths: ['node_modules/fancy-framework/less'],
    }
  }
};
```
Note that some options are overwritten: `paths` and `filename` are set by the plugin.
In production mode line numbers are suppressed.


### CSS Modules
Starting Brunch `2.6`, you can use CSS Modules with less-brunch. To enable it, change your config to:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    less: {
      modules: true
    }
  }
};
```

Then, author your styles like you normally would:

```less
.title {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

And reference CSS class names by requiring the specific style into your javascript:

```js
var style = require('./title.less');

<h1 className={style.title}>Yo</h1>
```

Note: enabling `cssModules` does so for every stylesheet in your project, so it's all-or-nothing. Even the files you don't require will be transformed into CSS modules (aka will have obfuscated class names, like turn `.title` into `._title_fdphn_1`).
